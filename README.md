# DOM Mini Apps

## Project Description

I developed a series of interactive mini-apps to enhance my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM). These simple web applications allowed users to interact with the webpage, utilizing various DOM manipulation techniques and CSS styling to create dynamic and engaging user experiences.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling and designing the visual layout of the mini-apps.
- **JavaScript:** For manipulating the DOM and adding interactive functionality.

## Features

### Front-End Planning

- **Project Planning:** Organized and planned the structure and functionality of each mini-app before development. Outlined key features, user interactions, and design elements.

### DOM Manipulation

- **Event Handling:** Implemented DOM event listeners to respond to user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements.
- **Element Creation:** Used JavaScript to dynamically create, modify, and remove elements on the webpage.
- **Content Updating:** Updated the content of DOM elements based on user interactions or other conditions.

### Styling with CSS

- **Design and Layout:** Applied CSS to style the mini-apps, including layout adjustments, color schemes, typography, and responsive design.
- **CSS Animations:** Incorporated basic animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.

### Resources Utilized

- **HTML DOM Events:** Utilized DOM events to trigger JavaScript functions in response to user interactions.
- **Document API:** Referenced the Document API for methods to access and manipulate the DOM structure.
- **Element API:** Applied methods from the Element API to handle specific elements within the DOM.
- **Node API:** Leveraged Node methods where applicable, understanding that elements are also types of nodes.
- **Timeouts and Intervals:** Used `setTimeout` and `setInterval` to manage delays and repetitive tasks in the mini-apps.
